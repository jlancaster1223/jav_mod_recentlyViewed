# Recently Viewed Setup

So, once you have installed the module and added the database table (this is packaged in and labeled as recentlyViewed.sql) you can do product setup.

Pop the following code at the top of your product page template
```php
use Module\Recentlyviewed\Controllers\Frontend as RecentlyviewedFacade;
$recentlyViewed = new RecentlyviewedFacade;
$recentlyViewed->addProduct($product['product_id']);
```
